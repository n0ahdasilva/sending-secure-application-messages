# sending-secure-application-messages
Establish a connection that sends secure application messages from a client to a server using the Python programming language. This process is similar to components that exist in many applications (e.g. secure email, SSH, ..). The secure connection should provide:

• Message confidentiality,

• Sender authentication,

• Message integrity,

• and symmetric key distribution
